########## Basic JavaScript Concepts Arrays ############

In this lesson we'll look at how to do string manipulation using arrays. 


####### What Are Arrays ########

Arrays are like a container that holds values and or variables and their data. 

--> in rare cases (static web application) will you use actual values

	--> in fact, when building web applications you'll be using a variable name of some sort to hold the value from:

	     1. user input
	     2. returned data from a database



* This should give you a strong visual of what an array is. Just remember in application there are three layers:

   1. Structure Layer (HTML/HTML5)
   2. Presentation Layer (CSS/CSS3)
   3. Behavioral Layer (JavaScript/jQuery)
